# VibeTune Fixes Applied

## Date: 2025-10-04

### 1. YouTube Music Sync Fix ✅

**Problem:** The sync functionality was failing because the API endpoints for playlists and liked songs were missing.

**Solution:**
- Created `/app/api/playlists/route.ts` - API endpoint to fetch user's YouTube Music playlists
- Created `/app/api/liked-songs/route.ts` - API endpoint to fetch user's liked songs
- Added `getLibraryPlaylists()` method to `YouTubeMusicInnerTube` class
- Added `getLikedSongs()` method to `YouTubeMusicInnerTube` class
- Enhanced error handling in sync operations to continue even if individual sync steps fail

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/youtube-music-innertube.ts` - Added new methods for fetching playlists and liked songs
- `app/api/playlists/route.ts` - NEW FILE
- `app/api/liked-songs/route.ts` - NEW FILE

### 2. Libre Music Support ✅

**Problem:** The app needed support for Libre.fm as an alternative open-source music source.

**Solution:**
- Created complete Libre.fm API integration
- Added search functionality for Libre.fm
- Added trending/top tracks from Libre.fm
- Integrated Libre.fm results into the main search functionality
- Search now queries both YouTube Music and Libre.fm in parallel for better results

**Files Created:**
- `lib/libre-music-api.ts` - Complete Libre.fm API client
- `app/api/libre-music/search/route.ts` - Libre.fm search endpoint
- `app/api/libre-music/trending/route.ts` - Libre.fm trending endpoint

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/music-data.tsx` - Enhanced `searchMusicEnhanced()` to include Libre.fm results

### 3. Search Functionality Improvements ✅

**Problem:** Search needed to be more robust and support multiple sources.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced search to query multiple sources (YouTube Music + Libre.fm) in parallel
- Improved error handling with Promise.allSettled to ensure partial results are returned
- Better categorization of search results (songs, artists, albums, playlists)
- Fallback mechanisms when one source fails

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/music-data.tsx` - Multi-source search implementation

### 4. Error Handling Improvements ✅

**Problem:** The app would fail completely if any API call failed.

**Solution:**
- Added try-catch blocks around all API calls
- Implemented graceful degradation - continue operation even if some features fail
- Better logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages

**Files Modified:**
- `contexts/sync-context.tsx` - Better error handling (needs manual review)
- All new API routes include comprehensive error handling

## Technical Details

### YouTube Music InnerTube Integration

The `YouTubeMusicInnerTube` class now supports:
- `getLibraryPlaylists()` - Fetches user's playlists from YouTube Music
- `getLikedSongs()` - Fetches user's liked videos/songs from YouTube Music

Both methods use the InnerTube API with proper browse endpoints:
- Playlists: `FEmusic_liked_playlists`
- Liked Songs: `FEmusic_liked_videos`

### Libre.fm Integration

The Libre.fm integration provides:
- Track search with pagination
- Top/trending tracks
- Artist top tracks
- Proper error handling and fallbacks

API endpoints:
- `/api/libre-music/search?query=...&page=1&limit=20`
- `/api/libre-music/trending?limit=20`

### Multi-Source Search

The enhanced search now:
1. Queries YouTube Music API
2. Queries Libre.fm API (in parallel)
3. Combines results from both sources
4. Returns comprehensive results even if one source fails

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Sync Functionality:**
   - Test with authenticated user
   - Verify playlists are fetched correctly
   - Verify liked songs are fetched correctly
   - Test error handling when API calls fail

2. **Search Functionality:**
   - Test search with various queries
   - Verify results from both YouTube Music and Libre.fm
   - Test pagination
   - Test error handling

3. **Libre.fm Integration:**
   - Test Libre.fm search independently
   - Test trending tracks
   - Verify proper fallback when Libre.fm is unavailable

## Known Limitations

1. **Authentication:** The sync functionality requires proper YouTube Music authentication tokens
2. **Libre.fm API Key:** Currently using a demo key - should be replaced with a proper API key in production
3. **Rate Limiting:** Consider implementing rate limiting for API calls
4. **Caching:** Consider adding caching for frequently accessed data

## Future Enhancements

1. **Download Support:** As mentioned in README, download functionality is planned
2. **More Music Sources:** Could add support for additional open-source music APIs
3. **Offline Mode:** Cache search results and playlists for offline access
4. **Better Sync:** Implement incremental sync instead of full sync each time

## Environment Variables Needed

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# YouTube API (already configured)
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key

# Libre.fm API (optional - uses demo key by default)
LIBRE_FM_API_KEY=your_libre_fm_api_key
```

## Deployment Notes

1. Ensure all environment variables are set in your deployment environment
2. Test the sync functionality with real user accounts
3. Monitor API rate limits and adjust as needed
4. Consider implementing caching to reduce API calls
